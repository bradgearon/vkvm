##vkvm: virtual kvm

+ a c++ library to switch what pc your monitors, mouse, and keyboard are used with (with a hotkey)
+ eventually (most likely) a node binding

###why?

+ its 2014: there is no need for hardware to do this (especially when its so damn expensive)
+ one must own Apple hardware to write code for ios (with code hinting)

###where?

+ windows only for now
+ written in such a way to make other platforms simple (hopefully) but only if someone writes it

###how?

+ clone this repo
+ build (for now) inputSwitch.vcproj
